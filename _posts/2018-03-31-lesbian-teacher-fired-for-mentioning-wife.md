Texas is at it again. A teacher was placed on leave in September because
one parent claimed that she had "discussed her sexuality with children."

What does that mean, you ask? It means she mentioned her wife whenever talking
about her family. It's pretty blatantly homophobic. It's obvious a straight
woman wouldn't get suspended from her job and "treated like a criminal" by the
school for talking about her husband.

The teacher's name is Stacy Bailey. She was an art teacher and one of the most
loved teachers at the school by the students. Yet, because someone complained
that she was gay, she was suspended.

Bailey and her supporters are lobbying for greater protection for LGBT+ teachers.
There's a [petition](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/lgbt-protection-for-misd-employees-and-students), which I recommend any sympathetic readers sign.

It's honestly horrifying how they are treating LGBT+ people. Texas is one of the
biggest offenders, as the Religious Right has a stranglehold on the state.
Please, support Bailey and others like her and sign the [petition](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/lgbt-protection-for-misd-employees-and-students).
